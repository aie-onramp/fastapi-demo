# 🛹 The Onramp, in a Nutshell

<aside>
🎯

This course is designed to help you get set up like a professional AI Engineer so that *you’re ready to build production LLM applications in 2026*.

We built it for people **committed to becoming AI Engineers who don't code daily yet but want to**. If that’s you, *you need AI-assisted software engineering reps* before tackling **any** intensive AI Engineering bootcamp.

**This course is for you if**: 1) you love building, 2) you learn best with accountability, and 3) you need access to 1:1 support with expert staff.

If you’re also a community member ready to bring the vibes into your [journey group](https://curiouslionlearning.com/why-group-learning/#Two_Types_of_Groups_Journey_and_Destination), that’s just icing on the AI Makerspace cake 🎂.

### 🤖 What is AI Engineering?

AI Engineering refers to `the industry-relevant skills that data science and engineering teams need to successfully **build, deploy, operate, and improve Large Language Model (LLM) applications in production environments**.`

### 🙋 Why we built this course

Our flagship 10-week course, [The AI Engineering Bootcamp](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/ai-eng-bootcamp), has had significant success helping students to become AI Engineers and to achieve their goals in the past two years since we launched in January of 2024.

However, many students are unable to succeed in the rigorous, 10-week bootcamp due to a lack of prerequisites. They simply do not yet have the reps in on software engineering to be able to come up to speed quickly enough to keep pace with such a demanding.

### 🧑‍💻 The ideal student in pursuit of “AI Engineering”

If you’re looking to test the waters to see if being an AI Engineer is right for you, *this course might be for you*.

If you’re sure that you will become an AI Engineer, but you simply lack the hours as a professional software engineer to date, *this course is definitely for you*.

To clarify, this course is ideal for you if:

- You **do not yet code every day**

AND

- You **want to code every day** or **you’re considering AI Engineer roles**

If you’re in it for the love of the game; that is, [building 🏗️, shipping 🚢, and sharing 🚀](https://aimakerspace.io/about-us/) in a way that aligns with our core values, you’ll be a great fit not only for the course but also for our community and for the long term.

The world will need people like you in the coming age of AI.

If this is you, welcome. 

You’re in the right place.

### 🏅 What success looks like

Success in AI Engineering means embracing failure. You'll need to overcome the developer barrier - enjoying debugging rather than avoiding it. 

The course teaches you to fix AI-generated code, not just generate it. 

When you must build independently without pre-packaged solutions, that's when real learning begins.

### 💡 Real Student Example

During Cohort 8 of The AIE Bootcamp, a student dropped after 5 weeks. Session 3 forced them to understand frontend-backend connections and deployment. 

They hit errors with endpoints, FastAPI, React - spent 5 days stuck using Cursor/ChatGPT, fell behind, and quit. 

Pre-built solutions like [The AI Engineer Challenge](https://aimakerspace.io/the-ai-engineering-bootcamp/aie-challenge/) can often *feel easy* - but what happens when you build independently?

### 🤔  Prerequisites

**🧩 Debugging**: able to focus on practical aspects of problems you encounter

🏗️ **End-to-End Builder**: You take ideas from concept to completion—building, shipping, and sharing your work.

🤔 **Curiosity**: You’re not afraid to say “I don’t know” and ask the tough (or simple) questions to grow faster.

### 🏆 **Grading**

There is no grading in this course. 

However, there will be **recommended homework assignments** that we will encourage you to share in our cohort’s build 🏗️-ship 🚢-share 🚀 channel on Discord. 

Additionally, you’ll  receive structured feedback each week through Discord code reviews and weekly support through our team of peer supporters.

If you continue to [The AI Engineering Bootcamp](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/ai-eng-bootcamp), we have a rigorous certification program.
